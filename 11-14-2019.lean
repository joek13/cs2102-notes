-- Why use LEAN?

"Is this stuff useful?"

- Functional programming is hot
    - much of FB Messenger is written in reason, an ungodly bastard child of JavaScript and OCaml

- Boolean satisfiability is NP-complete, so it is reducible to a number of other "hard" problems
    - practical SAT solvers still take exponential time

- Predicate logic
    - language of math,
    - language of specificaiton

- Design and implementation of programming language

- Proofs:
    - the language of verification
    - provable security
    - provable safety
    - provable privacy
